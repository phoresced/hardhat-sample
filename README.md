# Event RSVPing dApp

```shell
A codealong created by Women Build Web3 '#WBW3', as part of the the 30 Days of Web3 curriculum!

As a newbie developer and experienced socio-digital permaculture designer, I'm excited to be learning how to build a dApp in the context of event registration. This complements a concept very dear to me, rewarding community & stakeholder micro-contributions when they participate in events.

I'm excited to tinker with this codebase to incorporate skill accreditation, contribution to projects, and reputation in commons. For more information, read our concept overview (here)[https://www.notion.so/conomi/What-is-the-Events-Based-Economy-e06a38a5f7d94e51a881f84b59ce5575].
